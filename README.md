## Flow of Information
Something here i guess

## Setup
Run with python model_test.py to calculate semantic similarity RMSE and BLEU scores on a simple translation task for gpt-4o-mini and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (API key must be set up as an environment variable).
Run with streamlit run dashboard.py to display a dashboard showing model metrics and comparative graphs.
